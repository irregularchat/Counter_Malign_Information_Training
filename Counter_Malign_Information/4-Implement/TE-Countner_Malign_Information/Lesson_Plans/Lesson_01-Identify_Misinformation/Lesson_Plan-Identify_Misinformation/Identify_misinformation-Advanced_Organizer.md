# Identify Misinformation
## Learning Objective
 **Action:** Identify misinformation and disinformation effectively.

 **Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, research capabilities, and tools for deception detection analysis.

 **Standards:** 
Accurately identify misinformation and disinformation, ensuring that at least 95% of assessments are correct and report findings to the relevant authorities. Apply structured analytic techniques to detect potential deception.

1. _Write down two statements on the whiteboard, both of which are lies, but one is more egregious than the other._ 
    - Statement 1: "The Earth is flat." (Instructor may create a more egregious lie)
    - Statement 2: "The Earth is a cube." (Instructor may create a less egregious lie)
2. _Ask students to identify which statement they believe is true and explain why._ _Ask students “What was challenging about determining if the statements on the whiteboard were true or false?”_ (5 minutes)
