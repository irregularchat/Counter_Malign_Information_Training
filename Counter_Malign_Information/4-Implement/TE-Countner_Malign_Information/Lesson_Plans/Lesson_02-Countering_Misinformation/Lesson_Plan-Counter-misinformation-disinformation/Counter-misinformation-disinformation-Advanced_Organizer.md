# Learning Objective
### **Action:** Counter misinformation and disinformation effectively.
This is an exchange and will divert from typical ELM steps and instruction to allow for students to exchange their experiences and expertise of their environment by developing and implementing counter strategies.
### **Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, research capabilities, and tools for strategic communication.

### **Standards:** 
Successfully counter identified misinformation and disinformation, ensuring the dissemination of accurate information and reducing the spread of false information by 80%.

1. _Present students with a simulated scenario where a rumor is spreading rapidly._ (12 minutes)
2. Steps: 
	1. Instruct 2 students to leave the room. Outside of the room the students will be given instruction to spread misinformation about a specific topic.
	2. Instruct 1 student remaining in the room about the accurate information and ask them to remain in the room and not leave.
	2. The remaining students will be asked about their day and other small talk to create a relaxed environment.
	3. The 3 students will return to the room and begin spreading the misinformation they were given trying to get people to rush out of the room.
	4. Students that leave the room will be caught by an assistant instructor and asked to return to the room to discuss what they experienced.
3. _Ask students "What did you observe in the scenario?"_ (7 minutes)
