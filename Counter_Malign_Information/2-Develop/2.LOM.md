# Lesson Outline Matrix
Instructions:  
Determine the structure for your lesson based on all the previous steps and the referenced Doctrine. If your lesson teaches a single task or educational topic, write the action of the corresponding learning objective in the TLO. If your lesson will teach two or more tasks or educational topics, write the action statements of the corresponding learning objectives in the appropriate ELOs. You will then have to write a TLO that encompasses all ELOs. Include the domain/level and criticality standard of all objectives you include in your outline. If using ELOs, do not include a criticality standard for the TLO. NOTE: Insert all action statements in the areas marked in purple italic font.

Next, determine the instructional strategy and/or knowledge type for the lesson and ELOs if applicable (drop downs). Enter the learning steps (4 if TLO only, or 2 per ELO). Determine the domain and level of each LSA (drop down). Determine the method of instruction, media type(s), instructor to student ratio, and time of instruction for each LSA. MOI and media are drop-down menus. In the last column, describe how the lesson objectives will be assessed.

Create a lesson title and scope. Refer to the example of a scope statement.

## Lesson Title: Reacting to Misinformation and Disinformation in the Information Environment
