# Slide 13: MOM Framework Example
**Text:** "China's disinformation campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic."  
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world, including strained diplomatic ties and blurred perceptions of who or what is responsible for its origins. In response to allegations, China crafted an intricate social media campaign to clear its name. This campaign gained notoriety in June 2020 when Twitter removed 150,000 malicious Chinese accounts. The accretion of fictitious accounts suggests that China has emboldened its efforts to spread propaganda on Twitter in favor of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) objectives. Although previous Chinese propaganda campaigns had focused on demeaning the protests in Hong Kong, a massive wave of social media rhetoric promoting the Chinese government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak as a form of Great Power competition—initially downplaying the pandemic’s severity while seeking praise for the government’s draconian efforts to contain its spread—is a narrative that underscores the changing character of war.

---

# Slide 15: POP Framework Example
**Text:** "Tiananmen Square protests, Hong Kong protests, the Cultural Revolution."  
Have students find other examples of past opposition practices and analyze them using the POP framework to determine potential future misinformation strategies from this actor.

---

# Slide 16: Detailed Analysis: Manipulability of Sources (MOSES)
## Activity
- Discuss each component in detail.
- Ask students to provide examples of credible vs. manipulable sources.
- Have students analyze a given scenario using the MOSES framework.
- Questions to consider:
  - How reliable is the source in other stories?
  - What are the potential biases?
  - Is the source susceptible to manipulation?
  - What is the source's track record for accuracy?

---

# Slide 17: Detailed Analysis: Evaluation of Evidence (EVE)
## Activity
-

 Discuss each component in detail.
- Examples of strong vs. weak evidence.
  - Strong evidence: Multiple corroborating sources, verifiable data, expert analysis.
  - Weak evidence: Single unverified source, lack of context, emotional appeal, opinion-based.
- Have students analyze a given scenario using the EVE framework.

---

# Slide 18: EVE Framework Example
**Text:** "The Earth is flat." vs. "The Earth is a sphere."  
- Strong evidence: Scientific consensus, satellite imagery, mathematical calculations.
  - Such as the Earth's circumference, the curvature of the Earth, and the observations of celestial bodies. Time zones, seasons, and the shape of the Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse.
- Weak evidence: Personal belief, lack of scientific data, anecdotal accounts.
  - Such as the belief that the Earth looks flat from the ground, the absence of a visible curve, and the idea that water always finds its level.
