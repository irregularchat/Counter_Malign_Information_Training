# Identify Malign Information (Misinformation & Disinformation)
## Learning Objective
 **Action:** Identify misinformation and disinformation effectively.

 **Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, research capabilities, and tools for deception detection analysis.

 **Standards:** 
Accurately identify misinformation and disinformation, ensuring that at least 95% of assessments are correct and report findings to the relevant authorities. Apply structured analytic techniques to detect potential deception.

## Lesson ELM Steps

| Time | ELM Phase           | Comment                    |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 15   | Concrete Experience | Identifying Misinformation |
|      |                     |                            |
1. Write down two statements on the whiteboard, both of which are lies, but one is more egregious than the other.
    - Statement 1: "The Earth is flat." (Instructor may create a more egregious lie)
    - Statement 2: "The Earth is a cube." (Instructor may create a less egregious lie)
2. Ask students to identify which statement they believe is true and explain why. Ask students, "What was challenging about determining if the statements on the whiteboard were true or false?" (5 minutes)
