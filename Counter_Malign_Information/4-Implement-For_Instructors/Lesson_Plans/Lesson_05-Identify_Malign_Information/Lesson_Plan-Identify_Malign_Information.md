## APPENDIX C - Practical Exercises and Solutions

## Scenario:
![Califoria Globe](Audio_Visual-Identify_Malign_Information/Image-Case_Study2.1-California_Globe.png)
![The Federalist](Audio_Visual-Identify_Malign_Information/Image-Case_Study2.2-The_Federalist.png)

In October 2020, posts on social media and articles were published claiming that a new CDC study found the Majority of those infected with COVID-19 ‘always’ wore Masks (examples of the articles below). This claim was further elevated on October 15, 2020, a town hall broadcast by NBC, interviewed U.S. President Donald Trump. During this interview Trump stated, " But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it." Trump's source for this claim was the new study published by the CDC. Full transcription of this interview can be found here. This information was ultimately, misinterpreted. Below is the CDC's tweet addressing the misinformation.

![CDC Tweet](Audio_Visual-Identify_Malign_Information/Image-Case_Study2.3-CDC.png)
#### Objective for Students:
Develop a counter-strategy to expose and neutralize the disinformation campaign by CountryX. Ensure the strategy includes:
- Collecting and presenting evidence to refute the false claims.
- Engaging with international media and stakeholders to provide accurate information.
- Coordinating with social media platforms to identify and remove fake accounts and bots.
- Leveraging diplomatic channels to address the disinformation at the international level.

### NOTE: 
This scenario is fictional and for educational purposes only. It does not reflect real-world events or entities. Researching or obtaining information about the event is not required. The focus is on developing a strategic response to the scenario presented - developing the HOW rather than the WHAT. Detailed steps that someone else from your unit could follow without needing further explanation is the goal.
