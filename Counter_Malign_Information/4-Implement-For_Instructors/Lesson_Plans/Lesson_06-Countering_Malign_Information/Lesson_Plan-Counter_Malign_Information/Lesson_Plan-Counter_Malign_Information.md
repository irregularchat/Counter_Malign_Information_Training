### SCOPE OF LESSON

This 180-minute lesson is an intermediate orientation to developing counter-narratives to misinformation and disinformation. The end state of this lesson is for students to be able to recall and apply the necessary steps to effectively handle scenarios involving misinformation and disinformation. The author's intent is that students learn key principles and procedures through a series of scenario-based exercises. By the end of the lesson, students should have a solid grasp of the actions to take in the relevant scenarios. This lesson is common to all government officials working in the information environment and links to other parts of the curriculum by reinforcing the character attributes of accountability and responsibility.

### Learning Objectives

#### Terminal Learning Objective (TLO): 

> **Action**: Develop counter-narratives to misinformation.
> **Condition**: Triggered by the detection of misinformation or disinformation.
> **Standard**: Create effective counter-narratives that address and refute misinformation with a success rate of 85% within 48 hours.

### Assessment Plan: 
If not covered in Section V (Student Evaluation), you may do a detailed write-up of the assessment procedures for the lesson in this appendix. You can include or refer to Test Control SOPs, procedures for procuring and grading tests, or procedures for conducting performance assessments. It is OK to include performance checklists here, but DO NOT include written test items or their answers in this appendix.

## Handouts

### Handout 1: Scenario 1 - Malign Information Spread by CountryX

#### Context:
CountryA is a small nation with a growing tourism industry, known for its vibrant culture and beautiful landscapes. Recently, CountryX, a foreign country with strong economic ties to CountryA, has been spreading misinformation about the safety of visiting CountryA. This misinformation has been disseminated through social media platforms, blogs, and some news outlets.

#### Details:
- A viral post on social media claims that a major tourist attraction in CountryA has been closed due to unsafe conditions and recent natural disasters.
- Multiple blogs have echoed these claims, citing anonymous sources and unverified reports.
- Some news outlets have picked up the story without fact-checking, causing panic among potential tourists and leading to a significant drop in tourism bookings.

#### Objective for Students:
Develop a counter-strategy to address and refute the misinformation being spread by CountryX. Ensure the strategy includes:
- Identifying and verifying the false claims.
- Creating and disseminating accurate information to reassure potential tourists.
- Engaging with social media platforms, blogs, and news outlets to correct the misinformation.

### NOTE: 
This scenario is fictional and for educational purposes only. It does not reflect real-world events or entities. Researching or obtaining information about the event is not required. The focus is on developing a strategic response to the scenario presented - developing the HOW rather than the WHAT. Detailed steps that someone else from your unit could follow without needing further explanation is the goal.

---

### Handout 2: Scenario 2 - Malign Information Campaign by CountryX

#### Context:
CountryA has recently discovered significant natural gas reserves, which could boost its economy and reduce its dependence on foreign energy. However, CountryX, seeing this as a potential threat to its own economic interests, has launched a disinformation campaign to undermine CountryA’s credibility and stability.

#### Details:
- CountryX’s state-sponsored media outlets are publishing false reports claiming that the natural gas reserves in CountryA are actually a cover-up for a secret nuclear weapons program.
- These reports include fabricated evidence and expert testimonies from paid analysts to lend credibility to the false claims.
- The disinformation campaign is coordinated across multiple channels, including social media, where bots and fake accounts amplify the message.
- International stakeholders and allies of CountryA are growing concerned and demanding explanations.

#### Objective for Students:
Develop a counter-strategy to expose and neutralize the disinformation campaign by CountryX. Ensure the strategy includes:
- Collecting and presenting evidence to refute the false claims.
- Engaging with international media and stakeholders to provide accurate information.
- Coordinating with social media platforms to identify and remove fake accounts and bots.
- Leveraging diplomatic channels to address the disinformation at the international level.

### NOTE: 
This scenario is fictional and for educational purposes only. It does not reflect real-world events or entities. Researching or obtaining information about the event is not required. The focus is on developing a strategic response to the scenario presented - developing the HOW rather than the WHAT. Detailed steps that someone else from your unit could follow without needing further explanation is the goal.
