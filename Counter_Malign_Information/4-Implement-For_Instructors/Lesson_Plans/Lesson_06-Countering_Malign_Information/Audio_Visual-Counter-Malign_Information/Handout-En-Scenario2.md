# Scenario 2: Malign Information Campaign by CountryX
## Context:
CountryA has recently discovered significant natural gas reserves, which could boost its economy and reduce its dependence on foreign energy. However, CountryX, seeing this as a potential threat to its own economic interests, has launched a disinformation campaign to undermine CountryA’s credibility and stability.

## Details:
- CountryX’s state-sponsored media outlets are publishing false reports claiming that the natural gas reserves in CountryA are actually a cover-up for a secret nuclear weapons program.
- These reports include fabricated evidence and expert testimonies from paid analysts to lend credibility to the false claims.
- The disinformation campaign is coordinated across multiple channels, including social media, where bots and fake accounts amplify the message.
- International stakeholders and allies of CountryA are growing concerned and demanding explanations.

## Objective for Students:
Develop a counter-strategy to expose and neutralize the disinformation campaign by CountryX. Ensure the strategy includes:
- Collecting and presenting evidence to refute the false claims.
- Engaging with international media and stakeholders to provide accurate information.
- Coordinating with social media platforms to identify and remove fake accounts and bots.
- Leveraging diplomatic channels to address the disinformation at the international level.
