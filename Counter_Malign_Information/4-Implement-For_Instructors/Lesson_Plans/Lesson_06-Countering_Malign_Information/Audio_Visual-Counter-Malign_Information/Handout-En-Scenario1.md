# Scenario 1: Malign Information Spread by CountryX
## Context:
CountryA is a small nation with a growing tourism industry, known for its vibrant culture and beautiful landscapes. Recently, CountryX, a foreign country with strong economic ties to CountryA, has been spreading misinformation about the safety of visiting CountryA. This misinformation has been disseminated through social media platforms, blogs, and some news outlets.

## Details:
- A viral post on social media claims that a major tourist attraction in CountryA has been closed due to unsafe conditions and recent natural disasters.
- Multiple blogs have echoed these claims, citing anonymous sources and unverified reports.
- Some news outlets have picked up the story without fact-checking, causing panic among potential tourists and leading to a significant drop in tourism bookings.

## Objective for Students:

- Identifying and verifying the false claims.
- Creating and disseminating accurate information to reassure potential tourists.
- Engaging with social media platforms, blogs, and news outlets to correct the misinformation.
