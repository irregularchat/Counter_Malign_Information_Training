## SECTION 1: ADMINISTRATIVE DATA 

### Instructional Guidance

**Conduct of Lesson** | **NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
- Watch the tutorial video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
- Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
- Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag.
