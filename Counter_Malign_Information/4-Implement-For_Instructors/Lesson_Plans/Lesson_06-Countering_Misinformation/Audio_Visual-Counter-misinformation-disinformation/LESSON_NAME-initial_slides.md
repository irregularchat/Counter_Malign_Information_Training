# CONTEXT
This template is for general outline of the slides for a lesson plan. The slides are designed to be used in a classroom setting to guide the instructor through the lesson. The slides are designed to be used in conjunction with the lesson plan document.

Slide Templates for PowerPoint, KeyNote, and LibreOffice Impress are available in this same directory `Audio_Visual-Template`.

Developer should review the lesson plan document and create slides for each section of the lesson plan. Slides should be developed in a MASTER SLIDE DECK first which may contain much more detail than appropriate for presentation purposes. The MASTER SLIDE DECK is also where translated versions of the slides should be created. 

Slides should be color coded with Yellow being English with details or English when presenting in a foreign language. When the MASTER SLIDE DECK is complete, the developer should create a copy of the MASTER SLIDE DECK and remove all slides that are not for presentation. Maintain the MASTER SLIDE DECK for future use and updates.
