# Advanced Organizer: Recognizing AI-Generated Content

## Learning Objective
**Action:** Identify Synthetic Media Content.

**Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, visual aids, research capabilities, and Synthetic Content detection tools.

**Standards:** 
Accurately identify AI-generated content by detecting inconsistencies and manipulation artifacts, ensuring that at least 90% of assessments are correct and report findings to the relevant authorities.

## Performance Steps

1. **Visual Cues**: Pay attention to specific visual cues (e.g., hands, limbs, face).
2. **Structural Consistency**: Analyze structural consistency in buildings and scenes.
3. **Textual Content**: Verify textual content for unnatural language patterns.
4. **Audio Content**: Check audio content for consistency and natural flow.

## Lesson ELM Steps

### 1. Concrete Experience (15 min)
#### Spotting Differences
- **Activity**: Display two sets of images, one original and one altered. Ask students to identify differences. (Images A and B) (5 minutes)
- **Activity**: Display two sets of extraordinary real images. Ask students to identify the fake image. (5 minutes)
- **Activity**: Students share their observations. (5 minutes)
- **Reveal**: Reveal which images were altered but do NOT discuss detection techniques yet.

---

### 2. Publish and Process (5 min)
#### Discussion on Observations
- **Introduce Learning Objectives**: Explain the goals of the lesson.
- **Instructional Lead-in**: "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to recognize AI-generated content effectively using specific detection techniques for images, text, and audio."

---

### 3. Generalize New Information (60 min)
#### Techniques for Detecting Synthetic Content
1. **Visual Aid**: Use handouts and visual aids to illustrate common signs of AI-generated content.
2. **Comparison**: Compare characteristics of authentic vs. AI-generated content.
3. **Techniques**: Introduce techniques for detecting AI manipulations (e.g., analyzing hands, facial features, and structural consistency).
4. **Demonstration**: Demonstrate using a Synthetic Content detection tool to identify manipulated content.
#### BREAK (10 min) in the middle of this section.

---

### 4. Develop (20 min)
#### Applying Detection Techniques
1. **Application**: Ask students how they will apply these techniques in their roles.
2. **Practice**: Have students practice detecting AI-generated content using example images and tools.

---

### 5. Apply (30 min)
#### Practical Exercise
1. **Exercise**: Provide students with various media types (images, text, audio) and ask them to identify AI-generated content.
2. **Review**: Students present their findings and discuss the effectiveness of their detection methods.
3. **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback on their observations and analysis.

---

### 6. Check On Learning (6 min)
#### Summary and Feedback
1. **Summary**: Recap the key points of the lesson.
2. **Q&A**: Answer any remaining questions from students.
3. **Reflection**: Discuss how the activity demonstrated the importance of attention to detail in recognizing AI-generated content.
4. **Future Application**: Encourage students to apply these techniques in their professional tasks involving AI detection.
