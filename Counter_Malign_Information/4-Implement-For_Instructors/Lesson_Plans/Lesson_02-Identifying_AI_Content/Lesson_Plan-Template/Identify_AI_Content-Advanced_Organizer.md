# Advanced Organizer: Recognizing AI-Generated Content

## Learning Objective
**Action:** Recognize AI-Generated Content.

**Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, visual aids, research capabilities, and AI content detection tools.

**Standards:** 
Accurately identify AI-generated content by detecting inconsistencies and manipulation artifacts, ensuring that at least 90% of assessments are correct and report findings to the relevant authorities.

# Performance Steps

1. Pay attention to specific visual cues (e.g., hands, limbs, face).
2. Analyze structural consistency in buildings and scenes.
3. Verify textual content for unnatural language patterns.
4. Check audio content for consistency and natural flow.

# Lesson ELM Steps

| Time   | ELM Phase           | Comment              |
| ------ | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 15 min | Concrete Experience | Spotting Differences |


Students write down any differences they notice
1. Display two sets of images, one original and one altered, and ask students to identify differences. (Images A and B) (5 minutes)
2. Display two sets of images, these are both real images but extrodinary in some way. Ask students to identify the fake image. (5 minutes)
3. Students share their observations. (5 minutes)
4. Reveal to the students which images were altered do NOT discuss the detection techniques used yet instead go to the publish and process phase. 


| Time  | ELM Phase           | Comment                    |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5 min | Publish and Process | Discussion on Observations |

1. Introduce the learning objectives.
2. Tell the students "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to recognize AI-generated content effectively using specific detection techniques for images, text, and audio. 

| Time   | ELM Phase                  | Comment                             |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 60 min | Generalize New Information | Techniques for Detecting AI Content |


1. **Visual Aid**: Use handouts and visual aids to illustrate common signs of AI-generated content.
2. **Comparison**: Compare characteristics of authentic vs. AI-generated content.
3. **Techniques**: Introduce techniques for detecting AI manipulations (e.g., analyzing hands, facial features, and structural consistency).
4. **Demonstration**: Demonstrate using an AI content detection tool to identify manipulated content.

| Time  | ELM Phase            | Comment                                   |
| ----- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 20 min | Develop              | Applying Detection Techniques             |
|       |                      |                                           |
1. **Application**: Ask students how they will apply these techniques in their roles.
2. **Practice**: Have students practice detecting AI-generated content using example images and tools.

| Time   | ELM Phase | Comment            |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| 30 min | Apply     | Practical Exercise |

1. **Exercise**: Provide students with various media types (images, text, audio) and ask them to identify AI-generated content.
2. **Review**: Students present their findings and discuss the effectiveness of their detection methods.
3. **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback on their observations and analysis.

| Time  | ELM Phase         | Comment              |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| 6 min | Check On Learning | Summary and Feedback |

1. **Summary**: Recap the key points of the lesson.
2. **Q&A**: Answer any remaining questions from students.
3. **Reflection**: Discuss how the activity demonstrated the importance of attention to detail in recognizing AI-generated content.
4. **Future Application**: Encourage students to apply these techniques in their professional tasks involving AI detection.
