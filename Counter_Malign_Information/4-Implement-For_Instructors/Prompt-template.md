### SCOPE OF LESSON

This %%amount of time%% lesson is an %%level of training%% orientation %%to Commissary anti-robbery procedures%%. The **end state** of this lesson **%%is for new Commissary employees to be able to recall the necessary steps to take in the event of a robbery at the store%%**. The author's intent **is that new employees learn anti-robbery principles and procedures and choose appropriate actions during a series of scenario-based exercises. By the end of the lesson, new employees should have a solid grasp of the actions to take if the store is being robbed. This lesson is common to all Commissary departments and** links to other parts of the curriculum** by reinforcing the character attributes of accountability and responsibility.

### Instructional Guidance

**Conduct of Lesson** | **NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
- Watch the robbery video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
- Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
- Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag. 

### 1. The importance of this lesson: (Why)

Insert how this ties to the student's goals and mission, or how it makes their current operations easier, or more effective.

### 2. What we want our students to Achieve: (Outcomes/Standard)

Choose anti-robbery measures that are appropriate to the scenario based on your interpretation of both the scenario itself and the job aid. Choices must align with the anti-robbery principles taught in the lesson.

### Technique 2: Deception Detection

_“Analysts should routinely consider the possibility that adversaries are attempting to mislead them or to hide important information. The possibility of deception cannot be rejected simply because there is no evidence of it; if deception is well done, one should not expect to see evidence of it.”_ _(Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 134)_

*“Deception is an action intended by an adversary to influence the perceptions, decisions, or actions of another to the advantage of the deceiver. Deception Detection uses a set of checklists to help analysts determine when to look for deception, discover whether deception actually is present, and figure out what to do to avoid being deceived.” (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 255)*


**STEP 1**: Assess whether a good case can be made to employ Deception Detection techniques using Table 4.3 as your guide. If a case can be made that Cuba is motivated to deceive, state this as a hypothesis to be proved or disproved.” (Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 161)
“Analysts should be concerned about the possibility of deception when the following occurs:

1. The analysis hinges on a single critical piece of information or reporting.
2. Key information is received at a critical time—that is, when either the recipient or the potential deceiver has a great deal to gain or to lose.
3. Accepting new information would cause the recipient to expend or divert significant resources.
4. Accepting new information would require the analyst to alter a key assumption or key judgment.
5. The potential deceiver may have a feedback channel that illuminates whether and how the deception information is being processed and to what effect.
6. Information is received from a source whose bona fides are questionable.
7. The potential deceiver has a history of conducting deception.” (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 256)

![](media/table-4.3.png)


**STEP 2**: Consider Motive, Opportunity, and Means; Past Opposition Practices; Manipulability of Sources; and Evaluation of Evidence for the potential deceiver. Use the templates and questions in Table 4.4 as your guide. (Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 135)
#### Motive, Opportunity, and Means (MOM)

1. Motive: What are the goals and motives of the potential deceiver?
2. Channels: What means are available to the potential deceiver to feed information to us?
3. Risks: What consequences would the adversary suffer if such a deception were revealed?
4. Costs: Would the potential deceiver need to sacrifice sensitive information to establish the credibility of the deception channel?
5. Feedback: Does the potential deceiver have a feedback mechanism to monitor the impact of the deception operation? (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 261)
#### Past Opposition Practices (POP)

1. Does the adversary have a history of engaging in deception?
2. Does the current circumstance fit the pattern of past deceptions?
3. If not, are there other historical precedents?
4. If not, are there changed circumstances that would explain using this form of deception at this time? (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 262)
#### Manipulability of Sources (MOSES)

1. Is the source vulnerable to control or manipulation by the potential deceiver?
2. What is the basis for judging the source to be reliable?
3. Does the source have direct access or only indirect access to the information?
4. How good is the source’s track record of reporting? (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 263)

#### Evaluation of Evidence (EVE)

1. How accurate is the source’s reporting? Has the whole chain of evidence, including translations, been checked?
2. Does the critical evidence check out? Remember, the subsource can be more critical than the source.
3. Does evidence from one source of reporting (e.g., human intelligence) conflict with that coming from another source (e.g., signals intelligence or open-source reporting)?
4. Do other sources of information provide corroborating evidence?
5. Is the absence of evidence one would expect to see noteworthy? (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 264)
![](media/table-4.4.png)

Analytic Value Added. Summarize the results of all four matrices in terms of whether they tend to prove or disprove the deception hypothesis. Did the technique expose any embedded assumptions or critical gaps that need to be examined more critically? (Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 136)
