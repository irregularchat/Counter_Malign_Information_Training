### SCOPE OF LESSON

This %%amount of time%% lesson is an %%level of training%% orientation %%to Commissary anti-robbery procedures%%. The **end state** of this lesson **%%is for new Commissary employees to be able to recall the necessary steps to take in the event of a robbery at the store%%**. The author's intent **is that new employees learn anti-robbery principles and procedures and choose appropriate actions during a series of scenario-based exercises. By the end of the lesson, new employees should have a solid grasp of the actions to take if the store is being robbed. This lesson is common to all Commissary departments and** links to other parts of the curriculum** by reinforcing the character attributes of accountability and responsibility.

## SECTION 1: ADMINISTRATIVE DATA 

### Instructional Guidance

**Conduct of Lesson** | **NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
- Watch the robbery video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
- Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
- Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag. 

### 1. The importance of this lesson: (Why)

Insert how this ties to the student's goals and mission, or how it makes their current operations easier, or more effective.

### 2. What we want our students to Achieve: (Outcomes/Standard)

Choose anti-robbery measures that are appropriate to the scenario based on your interpretation of both the scenario itself and the job aid. Choices must align with the anti-robbery principles taught in the lesson.

### AI Content Detection
#### Authenticity of Content: Humans
1. **Pay attention to the hands and fingers**. Extra fingers? Shape or size anomalies? Color discrepancies can be indicative of AI manipulation.
2. **Pay attention to the limbs**. Are there extra limbs or limbs that reach impossibly far? These can be signs of synthetic manipulation.
3. **Pay attention to the face**. High-end DeepFake manipulations often target facial transformations.
4. **Pay attention to the cheeks and forehead**. Check for unnatural smoothness or excessive wrinkling. Mismatches in age appearance between the skin, hair, and eyes can signal manipulation.
5. **Pay attention to the eyes and eyebrows**. Look for shadows in unusual places, which can indicate a failure to fully replicate natural lighting.
6. **Pay attention to the glasses**. Check for consistent glare and changes as the person moves.
7. **Pay attention to facial hair**. Does the facial hair look natural? Inconsistencies here are common in DeepFakes.
8. **Pay attention to facial moles**. Evaluate whether moles appear realistic.
9. **Pay attention to blinking**. Does the blinking frequency look natural?
10. **Pay attention to the lip movements**. Watch for discrepancies in lip-syncing that could indicate a deepfake.

Test yourself at spotting AI-generated content [here](https://detectfakes.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)

#### Authenticity of Content: Buildings and Scenes
1. **Structural Consistency**: Verify the consistency of structural elements like windows and doors.
2. **Material Texture**: Look for sudden changes in texture, which AI often struggles with.
3. **Lighting and Shadows**: Check for natural interaction of light with objects, noting any inconsistencies.
4. **Perspective and Geometry**: Identify any distorted perspectives or geometries in the scene.
5. **Repetition in Detail**: Be wary of unnaturally repeated elements, such as furniture or decorations.
6. **Logic of the Scene**: Ensure all elements make logical sense within their contexts.
7. **Missing Elements**: Notice absent details that should be present, like light bulbs or chimneys.
8. **Nonsensical Object Placement**: Check for illogically placed objects.
9. **Inconsistent Architectural Elements**: Evaluate the logic behind the placement and number of elements like appliance controls.
10. **Distorted Patterns and Textures**: Check for continuity in patterns and textures across different surfaces.
11. **Disrupted Continuity**: Look for misalignments in elements that should connect seamlessly.
12. **Anomalies in Common Patterns**: AI may struggle with maintaining symmetry, especially in detailed patterns.

#### Resources to Detect Synthetic Images
- [Wasitai Detector](https://wasitai.com)

#### Authenticity of Content: Animals
#### Authenticity of Content: Text
1. **Language Consistency**: Detect unnatural phrasing or syntax that may indicate AI-generated text.
2. **Contextual Relevance**: Ensure the text remains relevant to the topic discussed, as AI can veer off-topic.
3. **Repetition**: Note repetitive phrases or words, which are common in AI-generated content.

#### Resources to Detect Synthetic Text
- [Scribbr AI Detector](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-detector/)

#### Authenticity of Content: Audio
1. **Voice Consistency**: Check for consistency in the voice's timbre and pitch over time.
2. **Background Noise**: Listen for inconsistencies or artificial sounding backgrounds.
3. **Speech Patterns**: Notice any unnatural pauses or changes in speech rhythm.
