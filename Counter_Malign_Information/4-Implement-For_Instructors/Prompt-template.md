# Lesson Context
# Job Aid for Creating AI-Generated Content

## Overview
This job aid provides guidance on generating AI content with minimal training. It includes services categorized by content type, example prompts, and best practices.

## Best Practices for Generating AI Content
When creating AI-generated content, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure the quality and relevance of the output. Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of AI content generation:

### General Tips
0. **Check for Accuracy**: Always review AI-generated content for factual accuracy and relevance.
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the content type, audience, and purpose when prompting the AI.
2. **Iterate and Refine**: Use iterative prompts to refine the generated content. Start broad and narrow down specifics.
3. **Provide Context**: Give the AI relevant context to generate more accurate and relevant content.
4. **Use Multiple Services**: Use a combination of tools to leverage different strengths and capabilities, such as google searching for existing scripts or repositories, images, or prompts for AI to generate content or using a text generating model to build a better prompt for image generating.
5. **Remind AI of Constraints**: If there are specific requirements or constraints, remind the AI in the prompt. For example, word count limits, tone, or style guidelines. Ask it not to be lazy and take it step by step.
6. **Make Templates**: Create templates with variables for common tasks to speed up the content generation process and maintain consistency. 


### Example Prompts
- **Text Generation**
  - Bad: "Write an article about data privacy."
  - Better: "You are an experty in cybersecurity, the audience is a new military soldier with minimal higher education, don't be lazy with your processing, take it step by step first considering the task, analyzing the result, then writing: Write a persuasive article that is at between 500 and 650 words about the importance of data privacy in the digital age for military families. Include examples of data breaches and their impact on individuals."
- **Visual Content**: 
  - Bad: "Design a logo for a nonprofit organization."
  - Better: "Don't be lazy, take it step by step. Imagine you are a seasoned graphic designer tasked with creating a logo for a nonprofit organization dedicated to environmental conservation. The logo must represent the organization’s core mission and values, which emphasize sustainability, community involvement, and nature preservation. Adhere strictly to the organization’s branding guidelines, using a color scheme of earthy greens and blues. Incorporate elements that symbolize nature (like leaves or the Earth), sustainability (such as a recycle symbol), and community (represented by interlinked hands or a network). The design should be simple but powerful, clearly conveying the organization’s commitment to environmental stewardship"
- **Code Generation**: 
  - Bad: "Write a function to download instagram images."
  - Better: 
    - 1. "Create an andvanced google search for a script or repo focused on downloading instagram content" [Search it manually or though GPT]
    - 2. "Don't be lazy, take it step by step. output all in markdown codeblock. You are a software developer working on a social media analytics tool. Write a Python function that downloads images from Instagram based on one or more specific hashtags, users, or keywords. The function should take the hashtag as input from the user, scrape the images and store them in a local directory. Ensure the function handles errors gracefully and provides feedback to the user on the download progress."

## SECTION 1: ADMINISTRATIVE DATA 

### Instructional Guidance

**Conduct of Lesson** | **NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
- Watch the robbery video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
- Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
- Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag. 

### 1. The importance of this lesson: (Why)

Insert how this ties to the student's goals and mission, or how it makes their current operations easier, or more effective.

### 2. What we want our students to Achieve: (Outcomes/Standard)

Choose anti-robbery measures that are appropriate to the scenario based on your interpretation of both the scenario itself and the job aid. Choices must align with the anti-robbery principles taught in the lesson.
