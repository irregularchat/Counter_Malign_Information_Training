# Required Student Handouts
All instructors are required to read and understand the following handouts. These handouts are required for the students to have a successful learning experience. 

Students will likely ask questions about the handouts, so it is important to be familiar with the content.
## Surveys
### Pre-Course Survey
- Opening Student Survey [Here](/Counter_Malign_Information_Training/Counter_Malign_Information/4-Implement/TE-Countner_Malign_Information/Evaluation/Course_Start_Survey-PF.md) This survey captures a baseline of the students' knowledge and experience with malign influence while also capturing demographic information.

### Malign Influence Survey
### Synthetic Content Survey
### Post-Course Survey
- Closing Survey [Here](/Counter_Malign_Information_Training/Counter_Malign_Information/4-Implement/TE-Countner_Malign_Information/Evaluation/Course_End_Survey-PF.md)



## Handouts Required (# of Copies: per # of Students)
### Opening
### Lesson 01: Create Synthetic Content
-  Generative AI Handout: Diagram with AI servies based on what the user wants to do. Text, Image, Video, Audio, and Text-to-Speech. (1:1)
- Sample prompts for the students to use with the Generative AI handout. (1:1)
### Lesson 02: Identify Synthetic Content
- Synthetic Content Identification Handout. This handout will include workflows for identifying synthetic content. (1:1)
- Concrete Experience (CE) handout with two images of a real person and a synthetic person. (1:2)
### Lesson 03
- Source Content Audience Media Effect (SCAME) handout (1:1)
### Lesson 04
- Counter Rival Influence Scenario 1 Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for.
- Counter Rival Influence Scenario 2 Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for.
### Lesson 05
- Key Assumptions Check Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) handout. (Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 185)
- Deception Detection Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) handouts: Past Opposition Practices (POP), Manipulability of Sources (MOSES), Motive, Opportunity, and Means (MOM), Evaluation of Evidence (EVE) (Pherson and Heuer, 2021, p. 264) (Beebe and Pherson, 2015, p. 161)
### Lesson 06
- Handout for Concrete Experience (CE) detailing the scenario for the students to experience. This handout should include the scenario and the instructions for the students to follow.
- Counter Mis/Disinformation Scenario 1 Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for.
- Counter Mis/Disinformation Scenario 2 Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for.
### CAPSTONE
- Capstone Scenario Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for including the four 4 lanes that make up the capstone scenario.
    - SCAME Lane Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will use with the SCAME to identify and analyze potential influence.
    - Counter Influence Lane Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for. Students will use the counter-influence techniques that they developed in the previous lessons to counter the influence in this scenario.
    - Counter Mis/Disinformation Lane Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will identify and then counter mis/disinformation against. Students will use the counter-mis/disinformation techniques that they developed in the previous lessons to counter the mis/disinformation in this scenario.
    - Reporting Lane Handout. This handout should include the scenario that students will be developing a counter-strategy for. Students will use the reporting techniques that they developed in the previous lessons to report the malign influence in this scenario.
