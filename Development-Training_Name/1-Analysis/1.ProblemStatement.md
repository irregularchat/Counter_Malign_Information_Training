# Problem Statement, Description, and Scope Template

## Mission:
Ensure the operational integrity and effectiveness of operations in the information environment (OIE) in Central and South America by enhancing partner nation information forces' ability to identify and counter malign information.

## Collective Task:
Counter Malign Information.

## Problem Statement

**Problem:**  
Military officials in Central America and the northern part of South America lack the skills and knowledge to effectively identify and counter misinformation and disinformation campaigns. This gap in capability impedes their ability to discern between reliable information and misinformation, detect and respond to disinformation campaigns, mitigate the impact of propaganda and malign influence, and recognize and counter deepfakes and other advanced manipulative media tactics.

## Problem Description

**Description:**  
The issue arises from the rapidly evolving nature of information technology and media manipulation tactics, which outpace current training programs. Military officials often lack the training to recognize various forms of propaganda, deepfakes, and malign influence operations. This inability to discern reliable information from manipulated content exposes them to influence operations that can compromise decision-making processes, erode public trust, and undermine national security. The performance gap is significant, with serious implications for the effectiveness and credibility of military operations in the region.

## Scope Statement

**Scope of the Performance Problem:**  
The problem affects a wide range of military officials across Central and South America. It has significant implications for national security, public trust, and operational effectiveness. The inability to counter misinformation and disinformation campaigns increases vulnerability to foreign and domestic malign influence operations, compromises decision-making, and erodes public trust in military operations. This performance gap impacts the overall mission readiness and effectiveness of military personnel tasked with maintaining information integrity.

### Impact Areas:

1. **Increased Vulnerability:**  
   The inability to identify and counter misinformation and disinformation increases susceptibility to influence operations, posing risks to operational security and the safety of military personnel and missions.

2. **Public Support:**  
   Ineffective handling of misinformation and disinformation erodes public trust in military communications and operations, undermining credibility and legitimacy, which in turn reduces public support and cooperation.

3. **Stability and Governance:**  
   The spread of misinformation and disinformation can destabilize political and social environments, weakening governance structures and making them more susceptible to adversarial influence operations.

4. **Operational Integrity:**  
   Failure to discern reliable information from manipulated content compromises operational integrity, leading to actions based on false information or inaction in critical situations, thereby undermining mission success.
