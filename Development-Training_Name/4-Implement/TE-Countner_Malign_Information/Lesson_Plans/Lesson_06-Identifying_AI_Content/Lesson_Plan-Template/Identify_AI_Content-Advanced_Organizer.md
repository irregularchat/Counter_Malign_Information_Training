# Advanced Organizer: Recognizing AI-Generated Content

## Learning Objective
### **Action:** Recognize AI-Generated Content.

### **Conditions:** 
Given an environment that allows the students to engage one another and the cadre openly, handouts, visual aids, research capabilities, and AI content detection tools.

### **Standards:** 
Accurately identify AI-generated content by detecting inconsistencies and manipulation artifacts, ensuring that at least 90% of assessments are correct and report findings to the relevant authorities.

# Performance Steps

1. Pay attention to specific visual cues (e.g., hands, limbs, face).
2. Analyze structural consistency in buildings and scenes.
3. Verify textual content for unnatural language patterns.
4. Check audio content for consistency and natural flow.
